# Axionax Protocol Testnet Audit Report v1.9.0
**Date:** 2025-12-10
**Auditor:** Senior System Architect (Cline)
**Protocol Version:** v1.9.0-testnet
**Status:** 🟢 PASSED - READY FOR PUBLIC TESTNET

## 1. Executive Summary
Following the remediation of findings from the v1.0 audit, the axionax protocol has been upgraded to **v1.9.0** and successfully deployed to the testnet environment. All critical security vulnerabilities in the consensus layer have been addressed, and the infrastructure has been hardened with secure deployment practices.

**Deployment Status:**
- **Web Interface:** https://axionax.org (Active)
- **Infrastructure Node:** 217.216.109.5 (Active)
- **Version:** v1.9.0-testnet

## 2. Findings Resolution Status

### ✅ A. Blockchain Layer (Consensus Security)
-   **Finding:** Stubbed `verify_proof` function.
-   **Resolution:** Implemented full Merkle proof verification in `core/consensus/src/lib.rs`. The engine now verifies proof size, root hash consistency, and Merkle sibling paths for all sampled data.
-   **Status:** **RESOLVED**

### ✅ B. Observability (KPIs)
-   **Finding:** Missing metrics and mocked frontend data.
-   **Resolution:** Prometheus metrics are now configured. The frontend (`apps/web`) has been updated to display real-time network status (Block Height, Active Validators) via the connection to the Infrastructure Node.
-   **Status:** **RESOLVED**

### ✅ C. DeAI Integration
-   **Finding:** Disconnected Python worker.
-   **Resolution:** The Auto-Selection Router (ASR) and DeAI Sentinel are now integrated via the `rust-python` bridge. Worker selection logic enforces fairness quotas and utilizes VRF weighting as per architecture specs.
-   **Status:** **RESOLVED**

### ✅ D. Infrastructure (Operational Security)
-   **Finding:** Insecure deployment scripts (hardcoded passwords, non-idempotent).
-   **Resolution:**
    -   `deploy-to-vps.sh` has been sanitized to remove hardcoded credentials.
    -   Deployment now requires environment variables for authentication.
    -   Nginx configuration hardened with SSL, Rate Limiting, and Headers.
    -   Automated backups implemented (`/var/backups/axionax`).
-   **Status:** **RESOLVED**

## 3. Deployment Verification

| Component | Version | Status | Endpoint |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Core Protocol** | v1.9.0 | 🟢 Healthy | Internal (30303) |
| **Frontend** | v1.9.0 | 🟢 Healthy | https://axionax.org |
| **Marketplace** | v1.9.0 | 🟢 Healthy | https://axionax.org/marketplace |
| **Explorer API** | v1.9.0 | 🟢 Healthy | https://axionax.org/api/ |

## 4. Recommendations for Mainnet
1.  **External Audit:** Engage a third-party security firm for smart contract auditing.
2.  **Key Management:** Transition validator keys to Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for Mainnet.
3.  **Stress Testing:** Schedule a distributed load test (50k+ TPS) before Mainnet launch.
