## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value the security community and believe in responsible disclosure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us protect our users.

### 🔒 Private Disclosure Process

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please use one of the following methods:

#### 1. GitHub Security Advisory (Preferred)
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/axionaxprotocol/axionax-web-universe/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details

#### 2. Email
Send details to: **security@axionax.org**

Encrypt sensitive information using our PGP key (available upon request).

#### 3. Discord (For urgent issues)
Direct message to: `@security-team` in our Discord server
- Join: https://discord.gg/axionax
- Request private channel for disclosure

## Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

#### Infrastructure
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS 1.3 encryption on all endpoints
- ✅ Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- ✅ DDoS protection via Cloudflare
- ✅ Regular security audits
- ✅ Automated dependency scanning
- ✅ Firewall rules (UFW/iptables)
- ✅ SSH key-only authentication

#### Application Security
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ CORS policies properly configured
- ✅ CSP (Content Security Policy) headers
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- ✅ XSS protection (React's built-in escaping)
- ✅ CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)

#### Smart Contracts
- ✅ Audited by professional firms
- ✅ OpenZeppelin battle-tested libraries
- ✅ Reentrancy guards
- ✅ Integer overflow protection (Solidity 0.8+)
- ✅ Access control patterns
- ✅ Emergency pause mechanism

#### Monitoring
- ✅ Real-time alerting (Prometheus + Grafana)
- ✅ Error tracking (Sentry)
- ✅ Log aggregation
- ✅ Intrusion detection
- ✅ Uptime monitoring
