## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/axionax-core.git
cd axionax-core

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/axionaxprotocol/axionax-core.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

**Prerequisites:**
- Go 1.21+ or Rust 1.75+
- Python 3.10+
- Git
- Docker (optional, for testing)

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r deai/requirements.txt

# Build and run all tests
./run_tests.sh
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

---

## 💻 Development Workflow

### 1. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### 2. Code Style

**Go Code:**
> *Note: The Go implementation is now considered legacy. New contributions should focus on the Rust/Python/TypeScript architecture.*
 
**Rust Code:**
```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy
```

**Python Code:**
```bash
# We recommend using tools like `black` for formatting and `flake8` or `pylint` for linting.
# pip install black flake8
black .
flake8 .
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

**Example:**
```
feat(asr): implement Top-K selection with VRF

Add VRF-weighted random selection from Top-K scored workers.
Includes quota enforcement and fairness boost calculations.

Closes #123
```

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test
go test ./pkg/asr -v

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Run benchmarks
make bench
```

### 4. Update Documentation

- Update relevant `.md` files
- Add inline code comments
- Update API documentation
- Add examples if needed

### 5. Checking for Broken Links

Before committing changes to HTML files, run the link checker script to ensure there are no broken links. This script uses `lychee` to find and report any issues.

```bash
# Run the link checker
./tools/check-links.sh
```

> **Note:** The script may report "Network error" for external links if you are in an offline environment. This is expected. Please focus on fixing any "File not found" errors for internal links.

### 6. Commit and Push

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat(asr): implement Top-K selection with VRF"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions/methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Cover edge cases
- Aim for >80% coverage

```go
func TestASRTopKSelection(t *testing.T) {
    workers := generateMockWorkers(100)
    asr := NewASR(64) // K = 64
    
    selected := asr.SelectTopK(workers)
    
    assert.Equal(t, 64, len(selected))
    // Additional assertions...
}
```

### Integration Tests

- Test component interactions
- Use testnet or local network
- Test realistic scenarios

### Performance Tests

```bash
# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Profile CPU
go test -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -bench=.

# Profile memory
go test -memprofile=mem.prof -bench=.
```

## 📖 Documentation Guidelines

### Code Comments

```go
// ASR implements the Auto-Selection Router for worker assignment.
// It scores workers based on Suitability, Performance, and FairnessBoost,
// then uses VRF to randomly select from the Top-K highest-scoring workers.
type ASR struct {
    k int // Top-K size (governance parameter)
    // ...
}
```

### Documentation Files

- Use Markdown format
- Include code examples
- Add diagrams when helpful
