### 2. Mainnet Launch Restriction

This codebase may be used for:

- ✅ **Private networks** (internal use, research)
- ✅ **Open source contributions** to the official project

**PROHIBITED without explicit written authorization:**
- ❌ Launching **public mainnets** with economic tokens

- 🏷️ Use a **clearly different name** in all interfaces
- ⚠️ Display **prominent warnings** that it's NOT official axionax

**Official chain IDs (RESERVED):**
