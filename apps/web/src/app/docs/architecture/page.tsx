            The Axionax Protocol is a Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for Decentralized AI (DeAI) workloads. It combines traditional PoS consensus for transactions with a novel Proof of Probabilistic Checking (PoPC) mechanism for verifiable inference.
          </p>

          <h2>Core Blockchain</h2>
          <p>
            At its foundation, Axionax is EVM-compatible. Smart contracts are written in Solidity, and users interact with the network using standard Ethereum tooling. However, the underlying node software is custom-built in Rust to maximize performance and memory safety.
          </p>

          <h2>The DeAI Layer</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional blockchains cannot perform heavy AI computations (like Automatic Speech Recognition or Fraud Detection) because every node must redundantly execute every instruction to reach consensus. AI models are non-deterministic and computationally expensive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Axionax solves this using the <strong>DeAI Layer</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Python Integration:</strong> Validators embed a Python runtime via PyO3, allowing them to load PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Whisper models directly into node memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Off-Chain Execution:</strong> Heavy ML tasks are executed off-chain by a subset of specialized "Worker Nodes".</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of Probabilistic Checking (PoPC):</strong> Instead of all nodes repeating the work, a single node generates a cryptographically sound "proof of execution". A random committee of validators checks this proof probabilistically. If the proof is valid with 99.99% confidence, the result is committed on-chain.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Marketplace Integration</h2>
          <p>
            Developers can lease compute resources via the <Link href="/marketplace">Axionax Marketplace</Link>. Transactions are handled by an Escrow smart contract:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>User deposits AXX tokens into an Escrow contract for Job X.</li>
            <li>Worker node performs the AI task.</li>
            <li>Worker node submits the result and PoPC proof to the network.</li>
            <li>Validators verify the proof.</li>
            <li>If verified, the Escrow contract automatically releases the AXX tokens to the worker.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Security & Audits</h2>
          <p>
            The protocol ensures economic finality. Malicious workers who submit invalid proofs face immediate slashing of their staked AXX tokens. The v1.9.0 testnet is actively undergoing security audits to validate these economic incentives.
